# Compare-liquidity-measures-in-C-

Overview:
For the FE 522 final project, our team chose a project where we calculated different liquidity measures for a particular.
We decided to use Pfizer stock and the liquidity measures would be computed using effective spread, realized spread, and the roll model.
We collected the trade and quote data for Pfizer TAQ filestock for the 10th of November 2020.
We found differing results from each method and will discuss our procedure and analysis throughout the report.
